# OneRepMax
iOS application to calculate your one rep maximum lift on weighted exercises.

How to use:
1. Enter weight used for an exercise (example, 135 lbs).
2. Adjust the slider for number of reps. 
3. Press the calculate button and view your estimated one rep maximum for the exercise.

Formula used: Brzycki
This version of the one rep maximum calculation can return accurate results, or at the very least provide starting points.
